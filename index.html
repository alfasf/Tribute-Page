            <li class="listings">Early Childhood</li>
          
              <p class="bodyparagraph">On October 11, 1884, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt was born into one of the oldest and wealthiest families in New York; nevertheless, her childhood was far from a fairy tale. Eleanor was shunned by her mother because she did not meet her standards; her mother even called her “Granny” when she was a little girl because she was not pretty enough to please her fashionable, party-loving mother. In contrast to her relationship with her mother, Eleanor Eleanor as a teen was very close to her father. Before she was 11 years old, Eleanor was left a lonely orphan by her mother’s sudden death and her father’s death from alcoholism shortly afterward. For the remaining years of her childhood, Eleanor grew up with her grandmother, learning the importance of manners, being a young lady, and helping the less fortunate.</p>

            <p class="bodyparagraph">When she was a teenager, her grandmother sent her to Allenswood Academy, a boarding school in England. There Eleanor was happy for perhaps the first time. Marie Souvestre, the headmistress of Allenswood Academy, influenced Eleanor on the significance of public duty, and she became Eleanor’s first role model. After she returned to New York, Eleanor became involved with social work. When she was not yet 20 years old, she learned about the labor conditions of sweatshops and tenement housing. She was curious about everything and even walked on a picket line to express her concern and dedication for the rights of laborers. This marked the start of her life of public service, and she became a “voice for people who had none” (Eleanor Roosevelt: The American Experience). Despite the struggles she faced in her childhood, she took what she learned from Souvestre, and decided to help others who were less fortunate. Even though she was born into the wealthy class, “she transcended the limitations of her background and became a champion of those who, as a child, she would perhaps not even have acknowledged”</p>

            <p class="bodyparagraph">Eleanor and FranklinShortly after returning to New York from England, she re-connected with her distant cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and on March 17, 1905, the two were married. They had six children, but one died in infancy, which devastated Eleanor. Throughout their marriage, FDR’s mother allowed them no privacy and was very controlling. Eleanor’s mother-in-law constantly interrupted the two with her opinions on everything; she even asked Eleanor to give up her social work, which Eleanor refused to do. When FDR became an undersecretary of the Navy, the family moved to Washington D.C., but Eleanor did not enjoy that lifestyle of cocktail parties and dances. Instead, she did more public work and became very active in the Red Cross. She faced another struggle when in 1918 she discovered FDR’s affair with her personal assistant Lucy Mercer. Eleanor was crushed, and their marriage was never the same. They could not divorce because FDR wanted to become President, and a divorce would have ruined his public image. Around that time, Eleanor received more upsetting news when she learned of the death of her grandmother Hall, who had raised her. Eleanor took this chance to re-evaluate her life; she realized that she did not want to be only a wife and mother. She needed something more. </p>

            <p class="bodyparagraph">Eleanor became First Lady of the United States when FDR was inaugurated on March 4, 1933. Having known all of the twentieth century's previous First Ladies, she was seriously depressed at having to assume the role, which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing</p>
            </div><!--end of div with img-->
           
            <p class="bodyparagraph">With support from Howe and Hickok, Roosevelt set out to redefine the position. According to her biographer Cook, she became "the most controversial First Lady in United States history" in the process.[82] Despite criticism of them both, with her husband's strong support she continued with the active business and speaking agenda she had begun before assuming the role of First Lady in an era when few married women had careers. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences and in 1940 became the first to speak at a national party convention.[83] She also wrote a daily and widely syndicated newspaper column, "My Day", another first for a presidential spouse.[84][85] She was also the first First Lady to write a monthly magazine column and to host a weekly radio show.[86]</p>
          <li class="listings">Later Years</li>
            <p class="bodyparagraph">By the 1950s, Roosevelt's international role as spokesperson for women led her to stop publicly criticizing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), although she never supported it. In the early 1960s, she announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA was no longer a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if they wanted it. In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, Esther Peterson proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission, with Peterson as director. This was Roosevelt's last public position.[187] She died just before the commission issued its report. It concluded that female equality was best achieved by recognition of gender differences and needs, and not by an Equal Rights Amendment.</p>
            <p class="bodyparagraph">In April 1960, Roosevelt was diagnosed with aplastic anemia soon after being struck by a car in New York City. In 1962, she was given steroids, which activated a dormant case of bone marrow tuberculosis,[191] and she died of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home at 55 East 74th Street on the Upper East Side[192] on November 7, 1962, at the age of 78.[191][193] Her daughter Anna took care of Roosevelt when she was terminally ill in 1962. President John F. Kennedy ordered all United States flags lowered to half-staff throughout the world on November 8 in tribute to Roosevelt.</p>
            <p class="bodyparagraph">Among other prominent attendees, President Kennedy and former presidents Truman and Eisenhower honored Roosevelt at funeral services in Hyde Park on November 10, 1962, where she was interred next to her husband in the Rose Garden at "Springwood", the Roosevelt family home.[194] At the services, Adlai Stevenson said: "What other single human being has touched and transformed the existence of so many?", adding, "She would rather light a candle than curse the darkness, and her glow has warmed the world.</p>

            <li class="listings">Diplomacy</li>
          
            <p class="bodyparagraph"> In December 1945, President Harry S. Truman appointed Eleanor as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.[2] In April 1946, she became the first chairperson of the preliminary United Nations Commission on Human Rights.[172] Eleanor remained chairperson when the Commission was established on a permanent basis in January 1947.[173] Along with René Cassin, John Peters Humphrey and others, she played an instrumental role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). </p>
            <p class="bodyparagraph"> In a speech on the night of September 28, 1948, Eleanor spoke in favor of the Declaration, calling it "the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere".[174] The Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly on December 10, 1948. The vote was unanimous, with eight abstentions: six Soviet Bloc countries as well as South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Roosevelt attributed the abstention of the Soviet bloc nations to Article 13, which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries.[175]
Roosevelt also served as the first United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights[176] and stayed on at that position until 1953, even after stepping down as chair of the Commission in 1951.[177] The UN posthumously awarded her one of its first Human Rights Prizes in 1968 in recognition of her work.[178]</p>
            <p class="bodyparagraph"></p>
          
          <li class="listings">Civil Rights</li>
          
            <img id="civilrightspic" class="img-fluid float-left" src="https://inroosevelthistory.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/58-341.jpg">
            <p class="bodyparagraph"> Through the 1930s, Eleanor became increasingly interested in civil rights. Although Franklin would not allow her to attend the 1934 and 1935 NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) annual conventions, she did join the Washington, D.C., chapter of the organization, becoming the first white D.C. resident to do so. She eventually became a board member. She actively supported anti-lynching legislation in 1934 and 1935, unlike her husband who was afraid of alienating Southern voters, which he thought would cost him reelection in 1936. When the Daughters of the American Revolution would not allow African American contralto Marion Anderson to give a concert in Constitution Hall in February 1939, Eleanor used her newspaper column to publically announce her resignation from the organization and her reasons for doing so as a means of protest.</p>
            <p class="bodyparagraph">In 1938, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare held its inaugural meeting in Alabama’s “Magic City.” Upon her arrival, Roosevelt sat directly beside an African American associate, ignoring the designated whites-only section en route. After being told that Birmingham’s segregationist policies prohibited whites and blacks from sitting together at public functions, the first lady asked for a ruler.</p>
            <p class="bodyparagraph"> “Now measure the distance between this chair and that one,” she said after somebody produced one. Upon examining this gap separating the white and black seating areas, the first lady placed her chair directly in its center. There she defiantly sat, in a racial no-man’s land, until the meeting concluded. “They were afraid to arrest her,” one witness claimed.</p>
            <p class="bodyparagraph"> Eleanor had a deep commitment to social reform. Her goal was to give a voice to people who did not have access to power. Among her many platforms for social reform were the abolition of child labor, the establishment of a minimum wage and the passage of legislation to protect workers.</p>
          
          <li class="listings">Public Speaking</li>
          
            <p class="bodyparagraph"> Eleanor Roosevelt was not only an outspoken advocate for civil rights, she was a well respected public speaker. Even though she was terrified of public speaking at first, she became one of the most effective public speakers of the 20th Century.</p>
